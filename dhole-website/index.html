                <h1>About dholes</h1>

                <p>
                    The dhole (pronounced dole) also known as the whistling dog. They are classified with wolves and
                    foxes in the canine family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dhole is a bit strange when it comes to fitting them in to dog
                    subfamilies, they have shorter jaws and females can have up to 12 pups per litter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are fast runners and good swimmers. This helps them survive the habitat they share with
                    tigers and other predatory animals.

                <h1>Habitat and Diet</h1>

                <p>
                    The dhole is found in eastern and southern Asia. They vary depending on their habitat, but their
                    tail
                    is fox-like, usually with a black tip. They also have a white belly, chest and feet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Acording to animals.sandiegozoo.org, the dhole maintains a large territory. <i><b>"They maintain a
                            very large territoryâ€”up to 34 square miles (88 square kilometers)!"</b></i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dholes are great at communicating and use a whistle to communicate with each other. They usually
                    hunt in a group with one lead dog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dholes prey upon hoofed mammals such as deer, goats, sheep, wild pigs and buffalo, just to name a
                    few.

                <p>
                    The dhole were hunted as vermin. Their habitat was cut down for resources and their food soruces were hunted by humans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There about 2,500 dholes left in the wild.
